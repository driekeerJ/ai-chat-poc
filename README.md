## Step 1. Create project
1. Go to `https://start.spring.io/`
2. Choose at least `openAI`, `Thymeleaf` and `Web`
3. Generate a project

## Step 2. Register your key for openAI
Put the following setting in your `application.properties`. I have put it in my local properties that will not be uploaded to git, for obvious reasons.
```bash
spring.ai.openai.api-key=YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY
```
